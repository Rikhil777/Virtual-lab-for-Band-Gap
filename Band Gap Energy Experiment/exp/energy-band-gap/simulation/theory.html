        Theory

    <!-- <p>
        A semiconductor has the energy band structure with the forbidden energy gap less than 2
        eV. For germanium, the energy gap is 0.7 eV and that for silicon it is 1.leV at 0 K. Energy of
        this magnitude cannot be imparted to an electron by an applied electric field. Hence the valence band
        remains full and the conduction band empty. Thus, these substances are nearly insulators
        at room temperatures.
        If the temperature is increased some of the valence electrons may gain enough thermal
        energy and move into the conduction band. Now these free electrons can move through the
        crystal under the action of a small electric field. When an electron moves from the valence band
        to the conduction band an electron vacancy is created in the valence band. This is called as a
        Hole. When some of the electrons move from the valence into the conduction band, equal number of holes are
        created in the valence band. Therefore, conduction is possible in the
        valence band too.
        The current flowing through a diode in the reverse bias condition is

        <br>
        where I<sub>s</sub> is the saturation current.
        <p>
        I<sub>s</sub> = A(N<sub>n</sub>e v<sub>n</sub> + N<sub>p</sub>ev<sub>p</sub>) exp(-E<sub>g</sub>/2kT) ------(2)

       <p>
        Here Np, N, are concentration of holes, electrons in P-type and N-type regions respectively and
        Vn, Vp are drift velocities of electrons and holes respectively, A is area of cross-section of
        junction region. Substituting for k as 8.616 x 10 eV/K, we have
        </p>
       <p>
        log I<sub>s</sub> = C - (E<sub>g</sub>/2.303*8.616*10<sup>-5</sup>*T)*1/2

        => log I<sub>s</sub> = C - 1/2 *(E<sub>g</sub>/0.198)(10<sup>3</sup>/T) -------(4)
        <br>
        As the saturation current is in micro(A), rewrinting eqn. (4) with saturation current in amperes, we get
        <br>
        log(I<sub>s</sub> * 10 <sup>-6</sup>) = C - 1/2 * (E<sub>g</sub>/0.198)*(10<sup>3</sup>/T) 
        <br>
        where A = C + 6 is a constant.
        <br>
        A graph of log I<sub>s</sub> along y - axis versus 10<sup>3</sup>/T along x - axis will be a straight line with a <u>negative slope</u>.
        <br>
        The Slope = 1/2 *E<sub>g</sub>/0.198  (in K)
        <br>   
        =>  E<sub>g</sub> = 2 * 0.198 * Slope   in eV

    </p> -->
    <p>In the case of insulators, the region between highest level of completely filled valence band and the lowest level of allowed conduction band is very wide. This is called energy gap, denoted by E<sub>g</sub> and is about 3 eV to 7 eV in case of insulators. In case of semiconductors, this energy gap is quite small. For example, in case of germanium, E<sub>g</sub> =0.7 eV and in case of silicon E<sub>g</sub> =1.1 eV. In semi conductors at low temperatures, there are few charges carrriers to move so conductivity is quite low. At higher temperatures, the donor or acceptor levels come in to action and provide charge carriers and hence the conduction increases. In addition to the dependence of the electrical conductivity on the number of free charges, it also depends on their mobility. However, mobility of the charge carriers somewhat decrease with increasing temperature but on the average the conductivity of the semiconductors rises with increasing temperature. To determine the energy gap of a semi-conducting material, we study the variation of its conductance with temperature. In reverse bias, the currents flowing through the junction are quite small and internal heating of the junction does not take place.   </p>
    <p>In the reverse bias, the saturated value of the reverse current for a PN junction diode is given by, </p>
    <p>I<sub>s</sub> =A.T<sup>3/2</sup> e <sup>-Eg/KT</sup> _ _ _ _ _(1)  </p>
    <p>Where,  </p>
    <p>A= constant term </p>
    <p>I<sub>s</sub> = saturation current in micro ampere  </p>
    <p>T = temperature of junction diode in Kelvin  </p>
    <p>E<sub>g</sub> = band gap in eV  </p>
    <p>K = Boltzman constant in eV per Kelvin  </p>
    <p>For small changes in temperature where log T can be treated as constant relation (1) can be written as  </p>

    <p>Graph between 10<sup>3</sup> /T as abscissa and log<sub>10</sub>Is as ordinate will be a straight line having a slope = 5.04E<sub>g</sub>  </p>
