    <h4>
        Theory
    </h4>
    <pre>
        A semiconductor has the energy band structure with the forbidden energy gap less than 2
        eV. For germanium, the energy gap is 0.7 eV and that for silicon it is 1.leV at 0 K. Energy of
        this magnitude cannot be imparted to an electron by an applied electric field. Hence the valence band
        remains full and the conduction band empty. Thus, these substances are nearly insulators
        at room temperatures.
        If the temperature is increased some of the valence electrons may gain enough thermal
        energy and move into the conduction band. Now these free electrons can move through the
        crystal under the action of a small electric field. When an electron moves from the valence band
        to the conduction band an electron vacancy is created in the valence band. This is called as a
        Hole. When some of the electrons move from the valence into the conduction band, equal number of holes are
        created in the valence band. Therefore, conduction is possible in the
        valence band too.
        The current flowing through a diode in the reverse bias condition is
        I={ exp } -1
        where I is the saturation current.
        I, = A(N,ev, + N,ev,) exp
        log I, =C
        log I, =C

        » log l, =C-10A 2 0.198
        Here Np, N, are concentration of holes, electrons in P-type and N-type regions respectively and
        Vn, Vp are drift velocities of electrons and holes respectively, A is area of cross-section of
        junction region. Substituting for k as 8.616 x 10 eV/K, we have

        log (l.x 109) -C-x(10)

        2 0.198
        Page | 18

        As the saturation current is in uA, rewriting eqn. (4) with saturation current in amperes, we get »log l,=
        A'-;*98"A where A'=(C+ 6) is a constant.
        A graph of log I, along y-axis versus 10°T along x-axis will be a straight line witha negative
        slope.
        Procedure:
        The slope =xE
